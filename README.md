#   Cognifyz Power BI Internship Project: Financial Data Analysis

##   Overview

This project was completed as part of a Data Analyst Internship at Cognifyz Technologies. The goal was to analyze a financial dataset using Power BI to derive actionable insights and create interactive dashboards. The project involved a series of tasks, from initial data exploration to the development of a comprehensive dashboard.

##   Skills Demonstrated

* Power BI Development
* Data Analysis
* Data Visualization
* Data Cleaning
* Requirements Analysis
* Report Generation

##   Project Description

The project was divided into the following key phases:

1.  **Data Exploration and Summary:**
    * Explored the provided dataset to understand its structure, variables, and key statistics.
    * Visualized summary statistics (e.g., average age, investment distributions) using Power BI.

2.  **Gender-based Analysis:**
    * Analyzed how investment preferences (Equity, Mutual Funds, Government Bonds) vary across genders.
    * Created Power BI charts to visualize and compare investment choices by gender.

3.  **Objective Analysis:**
    * Examined the relationship between investors' savings objectives (e.g., Capital Appreciation) and their investment choices.
    * Visualized preferred investment avenues for each savings objective.

4.  **Investment Duration and Frequency:**
    * Analyzed the distribution of investment durations.
    * Investigated how frequently investors monitor their investments and its impact on their investment preferences.

5.  **Reasons for Investment:**
    * Identified and visualized the primary reasons why individuals choose to invest (e.g., Better Returns, Tax Benefits).

6.  **Source of Information:**
    * Analyzed the sources from which investors obtain their investment information (e.g., Newspapers, Internet).
    * Visualized the most commonly used information sources.

7.  **Dashboard Development:**
    * Designed and developed an interactive Power BI dashboard to consolidate all findings.
    * Incorporated visualizations from the previous tasks and added interactive elements.
    * Summarized the key insights derived from the analysis.

##   Key Insights
